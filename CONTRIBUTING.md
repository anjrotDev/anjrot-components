### How to Contribute

To contribute you can watch the 4th video of the series "[Crea una librería de Componentes para React](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoOnCUvhzJYOk_s-NQOeWdzPaYmXZGzDj&si=QgQNZeidfgHmhrKE)" where you will have a tutorial on how to contribute to the project.

- No component can depend on other libraries, they have to be made only with Tailwind CSS classes.
- All comments, issues, commits, pull request, should be written in English to maintain a standard.
- All commits should be made with `npm run commit` to activate commitizen and get the proper format of the commit.

Once again thank you for your contribution and let's create a great project.🚀

Best Regards

Anjrot Dev
